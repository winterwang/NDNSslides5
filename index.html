# Background

.medium["Temporal eating patterns"--the **timing**, **frequency**, and **regularity** of food intake or eating occasions across the day may play a role in health outcomes:] 

- Interplay between timing of food intake and circadian rhythms, physiology, and metabolism. (Asher *et al* 2015, Cell) 

- Skipping breakfast is associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes. (Uemura *et al* 2015, J Epidemiol) 

- Shift workers have a higher risk of metabolic syndrome (De Bacquer *et al*, 2009 Int J Epidemiol) and type 2 diabetes (Pan *et al* 2011, PLoS Med).

- Evening energy intake is positively associated with overweight/obesity. (Almoosawi *et al* 2016, Proc Nutr Soc) 

- Three distinct temporal eating patterns were identified (next 2 slides) in both Australian poulation (Leech *et al* 2017, Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act) and general population in the UK (Mansukhani, R. &amp; Palla, L. 2018 Proc Nutr Soc).

???

- There is evidence indicating that "temporal eating patterns" is potentially associated with health outcomes.

- Here are some examples in the literature. 

- However, currently very few studies have investigated when/the timing people consume food throughout the day.

- Some initial work based on eating occasions at hourly time intervals throughout the day from survey data, revealed the presence of 3 groups of eaters. These analyses were based on total energy consumption.

# Australian (NNPAS)
.footnote[Leech *et al* 2017, Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act]


???

- Australian National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey found that in both men and women, Australian adults have three distinct eating patterns: 

- "Conventiional": about 40% in both men and women, had a high conditional probability (&gt; 0.7) for having meals at 12:00 and 18:00. 

- "Later lunch": about 30% in both men and women, had a more than 0.9 of probability of having lunch at 13:00.

- "Grazing": about 20%-30% in both men and women, had frequent but no obvious peak in probability of eating, and had higher probability of eating after 20:00 compared with the other two patterns.

# the UK NDNS RP

???

Similarly, three types of meal time classes were identified in the UK National Nutrion survey: 

- a standard meal class (the red line) 

- a later meal class (the green line) 

- an irregular meal time class (the blue line). 

28% of Men and 31% of women fell into the standard class &lt;br&gt;
35% of Men and 27% of women fell into the later class &lt;br&gt;
37% of Men and 42% of women fell into the irregular meal time class.

# Objectives

- .medium[Investigate the timing of eating within the day and specific nutrients -- carbohydrates.]

- .medium[~~Potentially we will also look at the temporal patterns of carbohydrates quality, more specifically intrinsic milk sugar, extrinsic milk sugar, starch and non-starch polysaccharide.~~]
 
- .medium[Additionally, depending on the findings of preceding analysis, the association between carbohydrates eating patterns and diabetes and/or obesity will be explored.]

In this project, we aimed to

# Chrononutrition and NDNS data

- First hurdle is represented by the need (for collection) of **suitable** data that record the timing of food consumption.

- National Diet and Nutrition Survey 2008-2016 presents an opportunity: 
    - Collects 3 or 4 consecutive days' diet diaries from about 1000 people yearly; 
    - Reprensentative sample of the British population;
    - Records information on the time of eating for each eating occasion.

# NDNS RP data

- .medium[[The NDNS RP](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-diet-and-nutrition-survey) is an ongoing programme funded by the UK government on the purpose of surveillance of the food consumption, nutrient intake, and nutritional status of the general UK population.]

- .medium[Data can be downloaded from [the UK data service](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/)] after application (within 30 min).

- .medium[Collection of dietary data: the four-day food diary.]

???
Let's briefly explain the data source, 

(on the slides)

The food diary contains 4 consecutive days of dietary records. Participants were provided with a diary and asked to keep a record of everything they ate and drank over these four days, both in and outside the home.

The example of the food diary is shown in the next few slides.

# Challenges 

- Timing of food intake may vary depending on 
  - different classification of time (temporal intervals); 
  - Use of nutrients or foods or perhaps energy intake.

- Which kind of statistical methods are suitable for conducting **unsupervised learning** about temporal eating patterns in a more synthetic and interpretable way?

### How can we account &lt;br&gt; for the data collected &lt;br&gt; **over the 4 days and nested** &lt;br&gt; within the same person ?

# Latent class analysis (1)

- Latent Class Analysis (LCA): to separate people into several eating pattern groups and also to calculate the probability of an Eating Occasion (EO) occurring for each class for every hour of the day. 

- Let `\(L\)` be the categorical latent variable with `\(c = 1,\cdots, C\)` latent classes. `\(r_c\)` represents the **prevalence/the probability** of latent variable. 

- The latent classes are defined to be **mutually exclusive and exhaustive**. Therefore, `$$\sum_{c=1}^Cr_c = 1$$` 



---
class: middle
# Latent class analysis (2)


- The item response probability `\(\rho_{j, r_j | c}\)` represents the probability of the response `\(r_j\)` to observed variable `\(j\)`, given (conditional on) membership in latent class `\(c\)`.

`$$\sum_{r_j = 1}^{R_j}\rho_{j,r_j|c} = 1$$`

- Because `$$P(\overrightarrow{Y} = \overrightarrow{y} | L = c) = \prod_{j = 1}^J\prod_{r_j = 1}^{R_j}\rho_{j,r_j|c}$$`

- Also because the [definition of conditional probability](https://wangcc.me/seminar_2019/#8): `\(P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(A|B)\)`: 

`$$P(\overrightarrow{Y} = \overrightarrow{y}  \cap L = c) = P(L = c)P(\overrightarrow{Y} = \overrightarrow{y} | L = c)$$`

???
because each individual provides one response to variable `\(j\)`, the vector of item-response probabilities for a pariticular variable conditional on a particular latent class sums to 1.

# Latent class analysis (3)

$$
`\begin{aligned}
P(\overrightarrow{Y} = \overrightarrow{y}  \cap L = c) &amp;= P(L = c)P(\overrightarrow{Y} = \overrightarrow{y} | L = c) \\
                                 &amp;= r_c \prod_{j = 1}^J\prod_{r_j = 1}^{R_j}\rho_{j,r_j|c}
\end{aligned}`
$$

- Also because 

`$$P(\overrightarrow{Y} = \overrightarrow{y} ) = \sum_{c = 1}^CP(\overrightarrow{Y} = \overrightarrow{y}  \cap L = c)$$`

- Therefore, 

`$$P(\overrightarrow{Y} = \overrightarrow{y} ) = \sum_{c = 1}^Cr_c \prod_{j = 1}^J\prod_{r_j = 1}^{R_j}\rho_{j,r_j|c}$$`

# Multilevel LCA (1)

We already know that (if we know the distribution of `\(r_{ck}\)`) multilevel logistic regression can be defined as:
$$
`\begin{aligned}
\text{logit}[P(C_{ik}) = r_{ck}] &amp; = \beta_{0k} + \beta_{1}x_{ik} \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \textbf{(day-level)}  \\
\beta_{0k} &amp; = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 w_k + u_{0k} \; \textbf{(individual-level)} \\ 
\Rightarrow P(C_{ik}) &amp; = \frac{\exp{(\gamma_0 + \beta_{1}x_{ik} + \gamma_1 w_k + u_{0k})}}{1 + \exp{(\gamma_0 + \beta_{1}x_{ik} + \gamma_1 w_k + u_{0k})}} \\
\end{aligned}`
$$

- `\(P(C_{ik}) = r_{ck}\)` Represents the randomly selected `\(i\)`th observation **day** of the `\(k\)`th individual is **a particular carbohydrate eating day `\(c\)`**.

- `\(\beta_{0k}\)` is the random intercept; 

- `\(u_{0k} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{u_0})\)` where `\(\sigma^2_{u_0}\)` indicates the influence of the **individuals**.

# Multilevel LCA (2)

So, we can extend the LCA model with random intercepts that allows the same person to have different probabilities across several days of data: 

`$$P(\overrightarrow{Y_k} = \overrightarrow{y_k}) = \sum_{c = 1}^Cr_{ck} \prod_{j = 1}^J\prod_{r_j = 1}^{R_j}\rho_{j,r_j|c,k}$$`

## Data description &lt;br&gt;and choices made for modelling: 

- 24483 days observed on 6155 adults (2537 men and 3618 women); 

- Seven time slots as in NDNS classification; 

- Categorization of caborhydrate (CH) consumption: 

    - no intake;
    - CH contributed &gt;= 50% of total energy intake; 
    - CH contributed &lt; 50% of total energy intake.

# Discussion

- Low-CH eaters cunsumed the highest amount of total energy intake (7985.5 kJ), and had higher percentages of energy contributed by fat and alcohol, especially after 8 pm. 

- Moderate-CH eaters consumed the lowest amount of total energy (7341.8 kJ) while they had the tendency of eating later in the day. 

- Hig-CH eaters consumed most of their CH and energy within time slots of 6-9 am, 12-2 pm, and 5-8 pm. 


- The high-CH eaters' profile seemed to be the healthiest. 

- Low-CH eaters may have resulted from health/weight concerns, leading to fat or alcohol as replacements for CH.
