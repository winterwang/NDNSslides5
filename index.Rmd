# Background

.medium["Temporal eating patterns"--the timing, frequency, and regularity of food intake or eating occasions across the day may play a role in health outcomes:] 

- Interplay between timing of food intake and circadian rhythms, physiology, and metabolism. `r Citet(myBib, "Asher2015")`

- Skipping breakfast is associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes. `r Citet(myBib, "uemura_breakfast_2015")`

- Shift workers have a higher risk of metabolic syndrome `r Citet(myBib, "DeBacquer2009")` and type 2 diabetes `r Citet(myBib, "Pan2011")`.

- Evening energy intake is positively associated with overweight/obesity. `r Citet(myBib, "Almoosawi2016")`

- Three distinct temporal eating patterns were identified (next 2 slides) in both Australian poulation `r Citet(myBib, "Leech2017")` and general population in the UK.

???

- There is evidence indicating that "temporal eating patterns" is potentially associated with health outcomes.

- Here are some examples in the literature. 

- However, currently very few studies have investigated when people consume food throughout the day.

- Some initial work based on eating occasions at hourly time intervals throughout the day from survey data, revealed the presence of 3 groups of eaters. These analyses were based on total evergy consumption.

# Australian (NNPAS)

???

- Australian National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey found that in both men and women, Australian adults have three distinct eating patterns: 

- "Conventiional": about 40% in both men and women, had a high conditional probability (> 0.7) for having meals at 12:00 and 18:00. 

- "Later lunch": about 30% in both men and women, had a more than 0.9 of probability of having lunch at 13:00.

- "Grazing": about 20%-30% in both men and women, had frequent but no obvious peak in probability of eating, and had higher probability of eating after 20:00 compared with the other two patterns.

Similarly, three types of meal time classes were identified in the UK National Nutrion survey: 

- a standard meal class (the red line) 

- a later meal class (the green line) 

- an irregular meal time class (the blue line). 

28% of Men and 31% of women fell into the standard class <br>
35% of Men and 27% of women fell into the later class <br>
37% of Men and 42% of women fell into the irregular meal time class.

# Objectives

- .medium[Investigate the timing of eating within the day and specific nutrients -- carbohydrates.]

- .medium[Potentially it can be broken down further into some of their components: starch, glucose, sucrose, maltose, fructose, lactose, etc.]
 
- .medium[Additionally, depending on the findings of preceding analysis, the association between carbohydrate eating patterns and diabetes and/or obesity will be explored.]

???

In this project, we aimed to

# Methods (1) -- data

- .medium[[the NDNS RP](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-diet-and-nutrition-survey) is an ongoing programme funded by the UK government on the purpose of surveillance of the food consumption, nutrient intake, and nutritional status of the general UK population.]

- .medium[Data can be downloaded from [the UK data service](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/)]

- .medium[Target population for this project: adults, age range 19-64 years (sample size: around 5250).]

- .medium[Collection of dietary data: the four-day food diary.]

???
Let's briefly explain the data source, 


The food diary contains 4 consecutive days of dietary records. Participants were provided with a diary and asked to keep a record of everything they ate and drank over these four days, both in and outide the home.

The example of the food diary is shown in the next few slides.

# Methods (2) -- analysis

- Latent Class Analysis (CLA): to separate people into several eating pattern groups and also to calculate the probability of an Eating Occasion (EO) occurring for each class for every hour of the day. 

- For every hour of the day whether an EO had occurred need to be calculated.

- The definition of an eating occasion specifically for carbohydrates need to be defined (total energy intake may also need to be adjusted).

- Multiple days (3-4 days) of dietary intake records need to be combined (average). 

- Association between the defined eating pattern groups defined by CLA and obesity/diabetes will be explored through by logistic regression models.

???

The statistical methods here we are going to use is Latent class analysis. I will need to go through the methodlogy of this technique and clarify the differences and similarities of LCA with cluster analysis and principal component analysis.

Further potential issues that I can anticipate currently is that (on the slides)...
