# Background

.medium["Temporal eating patterns"--the timing, frequency, and regularity of food intake or eating occasions across the day may play a role in health outcomes:] 

- Interplay between timing of food intake and circadian rhythms, physiology, and metabolism. `r Citet(myBib, "Asher2015")`

- Skipping breakfast is associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes. `r Citet(myBib, "uemura_breakfast_2015")`

- Shift workers have a higher risk of metabolic syndrome `r Citet(myBib, "DeBacquer2009")` and type 2 diabetes `r Citet(myBib, "Pan2011")`.

- Evening energy intake is positively associated with overweight/obesity. `r Citet(myBib, "Almoosawi2016")`

- Three distinct temporal eating patterns were identified (next 2 slides) in both Australian poulation `r Citet(myBib, "Leech2017")` and general population in the UK.

# Objectives

- .medium[Investigate the timing of eating within the day and specific nutrients -- carbohydrates.]

- .medium[Potentially it can be broken down further into some of their components: starch, glucose, sucrose, maltose, fructose, lactose, etc.]

- .medium[Additionally, depending on the findings of preceding analysis, the association between carbohydrate eating patterns and diabetes and/or obesity will be explored.]
